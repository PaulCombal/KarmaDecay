# KarmaDecay for Google Chrome
Unofficial Chrome extension for Reddit Karma Decay

Help me spread the extension to help get it the title of official extension! I prefer not to put this extension on the Chrome Web Store until this gets the official approbation.

As of right now, this extension supports images from most popular sites, as well as youtube videos.
That's not everything! I also added **support for 9gag**, so you can quickly see if something is stolen!
Note that this extension is compatible with RES.

This extension adds small links like that next to all supported posts:

## How can I try out this wonder?

This extension is now available [on the Chrome Web Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/karma-decay-for-reddit/jajhikapekalehefmoebgloganabcgee)
If you know what you're doing, and absolutely want the latest version, you can download the code and drop it in your extension tab.

### What are the permissions for?

* _Access and modify data from reddit.com_ : Obviously, needed to add links on the page
* _Manage apps and extensions_ : Needed to check whether or not [RES](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb) is present, for optimization reasons
