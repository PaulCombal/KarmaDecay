# KarmaDecay for Google Chrome
Unofficial Chrome extension for Reddit Karma Decay
Help me spread the extension to help get it the title of official extension! I prefer not to put this extension on the Chrome Web Store until this gets the official approbation.

As of right now, this extension supports images from imgur and reddit, as well as youtube videos.
Note that this extension is compatible with RES.

This extension adds small links like that next to all supported posts:

## How can I try out this wonder?
If you know what you're doing, and absolutely want the latest version, you can download the code and drop it in your extension tab. If you just want it running, just go to chrome://extensions, [download this file](https://mega.nz/#!o4J3yAbb!uPerEJIAmNd1GH-X0x_Gift3cJdud10pO9dZZ-8a5bw), then drag and drop it in your tab. That's it, well done :)
